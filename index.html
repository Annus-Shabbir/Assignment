    <h1>Small Industries In Pakistan:</h1>
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>  Cottage and small scale industries are for labour and provide employment to the 80% of the 
        people of rural areas.This work reduces rate of unimployment and offers opportunity 
        for self employment.Traditionally,women are not given permission to work outside the 
        homes so these small industries like: Candle making,Handicrafts e.t.c can be established
        in the homes.
    </p>
    <h2>Main body:</h2>
    <p>Cottage industries have gained very importance in cities and towns.There is a great
        demand of hand made things such as:Carpets,Cricket bats,Footballs e.t.c.Hand made things also
        have good quality that,s why people demand for hand made things.These goods can be 
        exported to many others countries and profit can be gained.
    </p>
        <h2>Why is it important to support small industries:</h2>
    <p>As ill luck would have it,we have not been providing much importance to the small industries.
         Its very important to support
         small-scale industries because many lights of  homes 
        are blown due to small industries.People have adopted this art as a profession
        many people earn by small industries,many people run
        the lights of their homes by these industries so, government and we all should promote
        and give importance to the small industries and more and more small industries should
        be established in rural areas so that,our unimployment rate lies to 0%.
      </p>
